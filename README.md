# Linear-Regression-with-Knime

The knime workflow trains a Linear Regression model to predict the price of a Lego set based on it's various features.
It includes the process of:

- Loading the Lego dataset and cleaning it to remove missing values and outliers

- Removing collinearity between independent variables

- Partitioning the dataset into train and test dataset

- Modelling a Linear Regressor and prediciting sales of lego sets in  test data

- Calculating the accuracy metrics of the model

- Plotting residual plot and histogram to visualize Linear Regression assumptions of homoscedasticity (constant variance) and normal distribution of error.
